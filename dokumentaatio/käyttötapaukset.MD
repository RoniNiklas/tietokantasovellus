# Technical tasks  
Differentiate between restaurant OWNER (see orders, menu CRUD) and restaurant EMPLOYEE (can browse orders, but not manage menu).  
Clean up the JS/HTML to separate files   
Rename stuff to make it clearer, make authorization functionality match other items rather than being in its own folder    
Error messages to user from stupid stuff (like trying to browse nonexistent or other restaurants' orders)
